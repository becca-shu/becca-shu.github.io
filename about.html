        <p>Hello and welcome!</p>

        <p>I’m a born-and-raised New Yorker and a tarot devotee. I fell in love with tarot in college, when a friend gifted me my first deck – I was captivated by the beautiful artistry and rich symbolism of the 78 cards.</p>

        <p>I read tarot cards to help others untangle dilemmas in their lives and take concrete steps towards change and healing. No matter their background or beliefs, everyone can benefit from the stories the cards have to tell.</p> 

        <p>I don’t claim to predict the future or discern the past. Instead, I understand the cards as manifestations of ancient archetypes, mirrors through which we can glimpse important truths about ourselves that were previously hidden. Powerful things happen when we make the familiar strange.</p>  

        <p>I invite you to explore the site. Please contact me if you would like to book an in-person reading in New York City, an email reading, or ask a question!</p>
