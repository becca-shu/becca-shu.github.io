        <p>Welcome.</p>
        <p>The questioner sits in front of me, watchful and quiet. Excitement and nervousness manifest in the way she sits on the edge of her seat, the twisting of her hands. Carefully, she asks her question, which – like most questions I receive – boils down to the following: <i>How do I become unafraid?</i></p>

        <p>I mull it over. I shuffle the deck and pass it to her. She shuffles. I shuffle once again. She cuts the deck.</p> 

        <p>I lay out the cards in a spread and turn them over one by one. I watch the questioner as I do so. Her eyes widen in recognition and curiosity. The colors, figures, and shapes of the tarot cards are little hooks into our consciousness, and they pull the questioner into her memories and half-remembered dreams.</p>

        <p>As she sits with me, her mind is halfway between this moment and other moments long past. She waits for me to tell her what it all means. To light the way forward.</p>

        <p>I take a deep breath and begin.</p>
