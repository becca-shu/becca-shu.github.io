        <p>Welcome.</p>

        <p>The questioner sits in front of me, watchful and quiet. Excitement and nervousness manifest in the way she sits on the edge of her seat, the twisting of her hands. Carefully, she asks her question, which – like most questions I receive – boils down to the following: <i>How do I become unafraid?</i></p>

        <p>I mull it over. I shuffle the deck and pass it to her. She shuffles. I shuffle once again. She cuts the deck.</p> 

        <p>I lay out the cards in a spread and turn them over one by one. I watch the questioner as I do so. Her eyes widen in recognition and curiosity. The colors, figures, and shapes of the tarot cards are little hooks into our consciousness, and they pull the questioner into her memories and half-remembered dreams.</p>

        <p>As she sits with me, her mind is halfway between this moment and other moments long past. She waits for me to tell her what it all means. To light the way forward.</p>

        <p>I take a deep breath and begin.</p>

        <p class='body-header'>About me.</p>
        <p>I’m a born-and-raised New Yorker and a tarot devotee. I fell in love with tarot in college, when a friend gifted me my first deck – I was captivated by the beautiful artistry and rich symbolism of the 78 cards.</p>

        <p>Since then, I have read tarot cards to help others untangle dilemmas in their lives and take concrete steps towards change and healing. No matter their background or beliefs, everyone can benefit from the stories the cards have to tell.</p> 

        <p>I don’t claim to predict the future or discern the past. Instead, I understand the cards as manifestations of ancient archetypes, mirrors through which we can glimpse important truths about ourselves that were previously hidden. Powerful things happen when we make the familiar strange.</p>  

        <p>I invite you to explore the site. Please contact me if you would like to book an in-person reading in New York City, or an email reading, or ask a question!</p>
