        <p>I cannot recommend Becca more highly for anyone looking for a nuanced and in-depth personal reading in a calm, compassionate space. After discussing my question together for a while, Becca drew four cards for me and spent about forty five minutes walking me through how each of the cards spoke to its position in the spread, to my question, and to each other.</p> 

        <p>This wasn't my first tarot reading, but it was the most attentive, considerate tarot reading I've been privy to; she kept unfolding layers of meaning and insight that astonished me. Becca really comprehensively illustrates all of the possibilities and interactions happening within your spread in response to your question, drawing from both a complex understanding of the cards and a deep, thoughtful empathy.</p> 

        <p>Her thorough care made a huge difference; weeks later, I still find myself drawing encouraging guidance from the reading. I left feeling distinctly seen and revitalized, which is a wonderful gift.</p>

        <p>Becca's readings have challenged me about many aspects of my self and my decisions. They've affirmed my emotions, my choices, and my ways of existing in the world. They've caused me to dig deeper, to go bigger, to engage harder. Becca's readings have been so powerful for me that they've led me to learn how to read and engage with cards on my own.</p> 

        <p>Additionally, I take in information in different ways than most people, and particularly struggle with auditory learning, which is the way most tarot readings are given. Becca has always been incredibly receptive to figuring out how to read for me in a way that allows me to most deeply understand what she's doing.</p> 

        <p>Lastly, as a transgender person, I am very wary of recommending non-trans sources of emotional labor to my trans and gender non-conforming friends, but I recommend Becca's readings with absolutely no hesitation.</p>

        <p>I could not more highly encourage you to try a reading with Becca.</p>

        <p>Becca is incredibly knowledgeable about tarot and takes the time to explain each card, each placement, and each spread to you in a way that's easy to understand even if you had no idea what any of it meant before the reading.</p> 

        <p>During my first reading, I was amazed at how, even though she wasn't aware of the details surrounding my question, she explained the cards' significance and how they related to my life in a way that was freakily accurate. I also liked how we were able to talk about it afterwards since I had input and more questions -- it wasn't a one-sided interaction.</p>

        <p>Finally, Becca took the time to explain her views on how tarot readings as a way to connect the cards to your own life and use them to move forward in a personally useful way.</p>

        <p>Becca is a kind and thoughtful reader, who I couldn't recommend more highly. As a someone who is relatively inexperienced with tarot, I appreciated the depth of her analogies as she explained the cards and connections that formed the basis of the reading. But, I'm more impressed by how she explored and presented a new way of looking at an old problem.</p> 

        <p>The strength of her readings comes from how these new perspectives continue to guide thoughts and actions. Days after my reading with Becca, I was still seeing new approaches I could only recognize because of the connections she made. Thank you!</p>
