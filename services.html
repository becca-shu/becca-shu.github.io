        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

        <p>In-person readings are available in New York City.  Once you contact me to request a reading, we will agree on a mutually convenient location, and a meeting time that works for both of us.</p> 

        <p>If you request an email reading, the reading will be emailed to you within a week, after I confirm that I’ve received your question.</p>

        <p>Cash, check, PayPal, and Venmo are all acceptable forms of payment. For in-person readings, payment will be due at the end of the reading. For email readings, payment will be due upon receipt of the reading.</p>

        <h2>Referrals</h2>

        <p>Refer a friend to me – if they book a reading, you’ll get a 25% discount on your next reading!</p>

        <p>Disclaimer: I’m not a doctor, a lawyer, or a financial advisor, and tarot is not a suitable replacement for any of the above.</p>
