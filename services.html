      <h2>How does it work?</h2>

      <p>In-person readings are available in New York City, at my apartment in Midtown Manhattan. If you contact me to book a reading, I will email you the address after we have agreed on a meeting time that works for both of us. If you book an email reading, the reading will be emailed to you within three business days.</p>

      <p>Cash, check, PayPal, or Venmo are all acceptable forms of payment. We will decide on a payment method that works for you, and payment will be due at the time of the reading.</p>

      <h2>Referrals</h2>

      <p>Disclaimer: I’m not a doctor, a lawyer, or a medical professional, and tarot is not a suitable replacement for any of the above. These readings are for entertainment purposes only.</p>
