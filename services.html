        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

        <p>In-person readings are available in New York City.  Once you contact me to request a reading, we will agree on a mutually convenient location, and a meeting time that works for both of us.</p>

        <p>
          If you're not able to meet in New York City for an in-person reading with me, you can request a written email reading through the <a href='contact.html'>contact form</a>. Once we’ve settled on your question for the cards and I’ve received your payment, I’ll email you the reading within five business days. The written email reading will be a document explaining the cards I’ve pulled to answer your question, a summary of takeaways from the spread, and pictures of the cards.
        </p>

        <p>Cash, check, PayPal, and Venmo are all acceptable forms of payment. </p>

        <h2>Referrals</h2>

        <p>Refer a friend to me – if they book a reading, you’ll get a 25% discount on your next reading!</p>

        <p class='centered bold italic'>Disclaimer: I’m not a doctor, a therapist, a lawyer, or a financial advisor, and tarot is not a suitable replacement for any of the above.</p>
